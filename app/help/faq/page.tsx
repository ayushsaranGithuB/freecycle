          <h3 className="font-semibold">What is this platform for?</h3>
          <p>
            Our platform helps people trade, sell, or give away their used
            electronics instead of throwing them away. It&apos;s designed to
            reduce e-waste and extend the life of devices like phones, laptops,
            tablets, and smartwatches.

            Is this a marketplace or a donation service?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Both! Users can list gadgets for sale, for trade, or give them away
            for free. Our goal is to keep devices in use, regardless of how
            they&apos;re passed on.

            Yes, you&apos;ll need to create a free account to list an item or
            contact a seller. We use accounts to track your impact and keep the
            community safe.

            What is e-waste and why is it dangerous?
          </h3>
          <p>
            E-waste refers to discarded electronics. Devices contain hazardous
            materials like lead, mercury, lithium, and cadmium. When thrown into
            landfills, these substances leak into soil and water, harming
            ecosystems and people.

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">
            How do you calculate how much waste I've prevented?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We use industry averages based on the type of device you trade or
            list. For example, a phone typically weighs ~200g and contains
            around 900mg of mercury, 15â€“20g of plastic, and trace amounts of
            lead. We total these numbers in your account so you can see your
            impact over time.

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">Where can I see my total impact?</h3>
          <p>
            Your profile page includes a running tally of how much e-waste
            you've prevented, including kilograms of diverted material and grams
            of hazardous chemicals kept out of landfills.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Platform & Mission</h2>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">Is this platform for profit?</h3>
          <p>
            No. This is a non-profit project focused entirely on reducing
            e-waste and supporting a circular economy. We don&apos;t charge
            listing fees or take commissions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">What is a circular economy?</h3>
          <p>
            A circular economy keeps resources in use for as long as possible
            through reuse, repair, and recycling. It&apos;s the opposite of a
            throwaway model. Our platform exists to power that kind of
            sustainable tech lifecycle.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">How are you funded?</h3>
          <p>
            We&apos;re supported by donations and grants. Our platform runs with
            minimal overhead and open-source principles. If you&apos;d like to
            support our mission, you can donate or contribute your time and
            skills.

            What categories of devices can I list?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Currently, we support categories like smartphones, laptops, tablets,
            smartwatches, game consoles, and headphones. More categories are
            coming soon.

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">How do trades or purchases work?</h3>
          <p>
            Once a user expresses interest in your listing, you&apos;ll connect
            via messaging to arrange shipping, payment, or in-person exchange.
            We don&apos;t facilitate payments, so always use secure and trusted
            methods.

            Is there any buyer/seller protection?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Because we don&apos;t process payments or charge fees, we don&apos;t
            offer formal protection. We recommend users meet locally when
            possible, use tracked shipping, and communicate clearly. Community
            trust is key to our platform&apos;s success.

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h3 className="font-semibold">Do I have to ship items myself?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, users are responsible for arranging and covering the cost of
            shipping unless you and the other party agree otherwise. We
            recommend using tracked and insured services when possible.

            What&apos;s the best way to ship electronics?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Pack devices securely using bubble wrap or padding. If available,
            reuse original boxes. Choose a shipping carrier that allows you to
            track the package and offers insurance for higher-value items.

            Can I limit listings to local pickup?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes. When creating a listing, you can specify if the item is
            available for shipping, local pickup, or both. This helps buyers
            filter listings based on their preferences.

            What happens if my item is lost or damaged in transit?
          </h3>
          <p>
            As a peer-to-peer platform, we don&apos;t handle shipping disputes.
            That&apos;s why we strongly recommend tracked and insured shipping.
            If a package is lost or damaged, file a claim directly with your
            shipping provider.
