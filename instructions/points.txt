Points Calculation Formula (v1 Draft)
Step 1: Base Value

Lookup:

Original MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)

Current Market Price (used market — eBay sold listings, Amazon Renewed, OLX, etc.)

Base Value =
min(Current Market Price, Original MSRP * 0.5)
(You cap it at half MSRP if market price is high to avoid points inflation.)

Step 2: Adjust for Age

Device Age (in years):

<1 year old: × 1.0 (no reduction)

1-2 years: × 0.9

2-3 years: × 0.8

3-5 years: × 0.6

5+ years: × 0.4

Step 3: Adjust for Condition

Conditions multipliers:

Like New: × 1.0

Good: × 0.85

Fair (scratches, minor issues): × 0.7

Poor (major flaws but working): × 0.5

Broken (for parts only): × 0.2

Step 4: Accessory Bonus

Add % bonus based on included accessories:

Original charger: +5%

Original box: +3%

Manuals/accessories: +2% (Cap accessory bonus at +10%)

Final Points Formula

Copy
Edit
Final Points = Base Value × Age Factor × Condition Factor × (1 + Accessory Bonus %)
Round down to nearest 5 points (e.g., 237 → 235).

Optional: Set a minimum points floor (e.g., no item is worth less than 20 points).
