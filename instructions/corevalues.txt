Freecycle Core Rules (v1):

Points Calculation:

Lookup original MSRP + current market value (maybe via external APIs or scrapers).

Apply modifiers: Age, Condition, Accessories.

No Haggling/Upgrades:

Items have fixed point values.

No bidding, topping up, or extra points for now (keeps it clean for v1).

Shipping:

Handled via external logistics partner (like Delhivery).

Buyer pays only the shipping costs.

Pickup/drop-off based on size, weight, and pincodes.


Trust System Components:

Connected Social Profiles: (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Google account)

ID Upload & Verification: (e.g., Govt ID, Driving License, Passport)

Transaction History:

Successful donations

Timely shipping

Accurate item descriptions

Ratings/Reviews:

Other users can leave feedback after a transaction (optional for v1 if you want simplicity)

Trust Score = combination of social, ID, and behavior signals.

This would:

Make buyers feel safer accepting items from strangers.

Make sellers motivated to maintain good standing.

Deter scams and low-quality listings.

Cold Start Problem:

No items = no users posting → no users posting = no items.
Solution: Give free points at signup + for verification to stimulate early activity.

Points Deficit Problem:

What if someone finds an item they love but doesn’t have enough points?
Solution: Allow bridging by buying small amounts of points — but keep the system clearly positioned around "earn, not buy."
