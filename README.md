# FREECYCLE — A Circular Economy for Tech

## The Problem:

Millions of perfectly usable tech items end up in landfills every year. Meanwhile, many people can't afford expensive gadgets or replacements. There’s no simple, trusted way to give old tech a second life — until now.

## Our Solution:

Freecycle is a circular marketplace where old tech finds new homes.

Users donate used tech and earn Points based on item value and condition.

Points can be spent to claim other tech items listed on the platform.

Buyers pay only shipping costs — no purchase price.

Verified profiles and transaction history build trust within the community.

# How It Works:

Donate your unused tech to earn Points.

Shop other listings using your Points.

Ship the item — buyer covers only shipping fees.

Basically creating a closed-loop circular economy for used tech — no real money changing hands, just effort and contribution. Some highlights:

Incentivized recycling: People are rewarded for keeping items in use.

No cash barrier: Anyone can join by giving, not paying.

Self-balancing: Points ensure supply and demand stay relatively healthy (you can't endlessly "buy" without contributing).

Focus on reuse > resale: It’s about matching needs, not maximizing profit.

# Why Freecycle:

Save money — Get tech without paying market prices.

Save the planet — Reduce e-waste and landfill overflow.

Build community — Trust-based exchanges powered by verified users.

## Our Mission:

Empower everyone to access technology affordably while promoting reuse and reducing global waste.

## Tagline:

Give Tech a Second Life. Get Something Back.

# How New Users Start:

New users receive starter Points when signing up.

Earn bonus Points by verifying ID, connecting social profiles, and completing their first donation.

If a user needs more Points to claim an item, they can buy extra Points at a small fee — but the primary economy remains donation-driven.

Bridge the Gap:

Need a few more Points to claim an item you love? You can top up Points instantly — but remember, Freecycle is all about giving to earn!

This way you frame buying points as a secondary, optional behavior, not the main one.
